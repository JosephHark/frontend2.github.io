        anything here will be ignored

    <p>The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities with theC programming
        language.- This is somethign that I didn't know</p>
    <p>JavaScript has seven different data types-

        String,

        Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.),

        Number,

        Boolean,

        Undefined,

        Null,
    </p>
    <p>Any value that isnâ€™t one of the primitive data types listed above is anobject. These include arrays, functions
        and object literals, which will be discussed in later chapters.</p>
    <p>The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings such as:

        Single quote marks \'

        Double quote marks \"

        End of line \n

        Carriage return \r

        Tab \t</p>
    <p>JavaScript is known as a weakly typed or loosely typed language. This means that you don't need to explicitly specify
        what data-type a variable is when you declare it. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard to find bugs in
        code, particularly when type-coercion takes place in the background.

        Strongly typedlanguages such as Java or Swift require the type of variables to be specified when they are
        declared. Trying to use the wrong data-type will cause an error.</p>
