        <h3>Chapter 8 CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top. If you only want to
                move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions
                respectively. To move 45px to the right along the x axis, include:

                transform: translateX(45px);
                To move up along the y axis by 30px, include:

                transform: translateY(-30px);</p>
            <p>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only
                one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or
                pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the
                element the same size, scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on.
                Providing different values will distort the element, as you’d expect:

                transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);
                As with translate , you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. These functions will scale
                only the horizontal dimensions or only the vertical dimensions respectively.</p>
            <p>Note that you shouldn’t declare a new transform : because of the cascade, a second transform would
                override the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform
                functions. We simply add our scale to the end of that space-separated list.</p>
            <p>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As with
                scale , by default the point of origin is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in
                degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise.</p>
            <p>Browser support for the transform-origin property is the same as for transform —prefixing being required
                when the transform property requires it:

                transform-origin: 0 0;</p>
            <p>The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction
                will be on the rotated axis.</p>
            <p>200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything slower will make the website
                seem slow, drawing generally unwanted attention to what was supposed to be a subtle effect. Anything
                faster may be too subtle.</p>
            <p>Now let’s combine all those values into a shorthand declaration:

                .ad-ad2 h1 span {
                transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
                }</p>
            <p></p>
        </ul>
