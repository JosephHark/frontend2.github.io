    <p>The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities with theC programming
        language.- This is somethign that I didn't know</p>
    <p>JavaScript has seven different data types-

        String,

        Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.),

        Number,

        Boolean,

        Undefined,

        Null,
    </p>
    <p>Any value that isnâ€™t one of the primitive data types listed above is anobject. These include arrays, functions
        and object literals, which will be discussed in later chapters.</p>
    <p>The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings such as:

        Single quote marks \'

        Double quote marks \"

        End of line \n

        Carriage return \r

        Tab \t</p>
    <p>JavaScript is known as a weakly typed or loosely typed language. This means that you don't need to explicitly
        specify
        what data-type a variable is when you declare it. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard to find bugs in
        code, particularly when type-coercion takes place in the background.

        Strongly typedlanguages such as Java or Swift require the type of variables to be specified when they are
        declared. Trying to use the wrong data-type will cause an error.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

    <p>Maps were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification. They are a convenient way of keeping a list
        of key and value pairs, and are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other programming
        languages.

        At first glance, maps appear to be similar to JavaScript objects (covered in Chapter 5), but they have some
        noticeable differences:

        Objects are limited to using strings for key values, whereas maps can use any data type as a key.
        There is no efficient way to find the number of key-value pairs an object has, whereas this is easy to do with
        maps using the size property.
        Objects have methods that can be called (see Chapter 5) and prototypes that can be used to create a chain of
        inheritance (see Chapter 12), whereas maps are solely focused on the storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.
        The value of an object's properties can be accessed directly, whereas maps restrict you to using the get()
        method to retrieve any values.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Creating Maps</strong>
        An empty map object can be created using the new operator and Map() constructor:

        const romanNumerals = new Map();
        There is, at the time of writing, no literal notation for creating maps.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Adding Entries To Maps</stong>
            The set() method can be used to add a key and value pair to a map. The first value is the key and the second
            is
            the value:

            romanNumerals.set(1,'I');
            Map { 1 => 'I' }
            The return value shows the mapping with the key connected to the value using the 'hash rocket' symbol ( =>
            ).

            Multiple items can be added to the set by repeatedly calling the set() method in one go:

            romanNumerals.set(2,'II').set(3,'III').set(4,'IV').set(5,'V');
            Map { 1 => 'I', 2 => 'II', 3 => 'III', 4 => 'IV', 5 => 'V' }
