        <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means they’re perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.<br>

            The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following format:<br>
            
            Start with data- .<br>
            
            Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.<br>
            
            Include an optional string value.<br>
            
            Examples could be:<br>
            
            data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'<br>
            data-rating = '5' <br>
            data-dropdown <br>
            data-user = 'DAZ' <br>
            data-max-length = '32'<br></p>
        <p>The support for the data- attribute is generally very good in modern browsers. Even Internet Explorer 8 has partial support! Some older browsers are unable to understand the dataset property, however, but any data- attribute can be found using the standard getAttribute method. So the previous code could be replaced with the following if you still need to support older browsers:

            const powers = superman.getAttribute('data-powers');</p>
        <p>At the time of writing, the Chrome browser won't let you run workers from local files like this. A workaround is start Chrome using the --allow-file-access-from-files flag, or simply use a different browser for this example.

            If you decide to use the --allow-file-access-from-files flag, make sure you only use this for development, rather than for regular browsing.</p>

        <p>The file containing the worker code is expected to be hosted on a server. This is the best option, but if you want to run an example locally you need to turn off thesame origin policysetting in the browser.</p>
