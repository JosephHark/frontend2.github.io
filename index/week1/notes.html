        <p>I have a working dynamic Portfolio, hopefully.</p>
        <p>When coding and working with CSS rememeber to design for mobile phones first, as opposed to the larger
            laptops or desktop computers.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason for this the quick turn over of mobile devices as compared to personal computers.</p>
        <p>Even if a website is repsonsive that doesn't mean that it's mobile first and headers, footers and other text
            ends up smushed, while you still have to scroll to see an image.</p>
            <p> know your users better than they know themselves. By not listening to what they are saying, but rather what theyre doing. This happens becuase as Jobs puts " your user don't know what they want until you show it to them."</p>
            <p>Ways to accoplish this 
                1. Be There.
                2. Be Useful.
                3. Be Quick.
                4. Reachability Matters
                5. Speed Matters
