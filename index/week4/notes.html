        <a href="search.html">Search</a>
        <p>Some common types of form control are:

            <strong>input</strong> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads

            <strong>select</strong> menus for drop-down lists of options

            <strong>textarea</strong> elements for longer text entry

            <strong>button</strong> elements for submitting and resetting forms
        </p>
        <a href="heroes.html">Search</a>
        <p>
            The input element includes some of the new attributes introduced in HTML5.

            The autofocus attribute give focus to this element when a page loads. It is the equivalent to putting the
            following line of JavaScript in main.js :

            document.forms.hero.heroName.focus();
            The placeholder attribute will insert the value provided in the input field until the user enters some text.
            This can be useful to place hints about how to fill in the form.

            The maxlength attribute will limit the number of characters that can be entered in the field to the value
            given (in this case 32).

            There are many new attributes that can be employed to make forms more user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>Hidden fields can be created using input fields with type='hidden' . These are not displayed by the browser,
            but have a 'value' attribute that can contain information that is submitted with the form. They are often
            used to send information such as settings or information that the user has already provided. Note that the
            information in these fields is in no way secret, as it’s visible in the HTML, so shouldn’t be used for
            sensitive data. The value of a hidden input field can be changed using JavaScript in the same was as any
            other input field.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 12</h3>

        <p>
            Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. There are
            three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.

            <strong>Encapsulation</strong>
            This demonstrates the concept of encapsulation: the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and
            only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user, such as the 'on' button. In OOP, this
            involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the
            functionality, without the outside world needing to knowhowit’s done.

            <strong>Polymorphism</strong>
            These examples demonstrate the concept of polymorphism: the same process can be used for different objects.
            In OOP, this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared
            methods with a more specific implementation.

            <strong>Inheritance</strong>
            This demonstrates the concept of inheritance: taking the features of one object then adding some new
            features. In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and
            methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p>
        <p>
            avaScript uses a prototypal inheritance model. This means that every class has a prototype property that is
            shared by every instance of the class. So any properties or methods of a class’s prototype can be accessed
            by every object instantiated by that class.

            To see how this works, let’s create a class for creating ninja turtles:

            class Turtle {
            constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
            this.weapon = 'hands';
            }
            sayHi() {
            return `Hi dude, my name is ${this.name}`;
            }
            attack(){
            return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`;
            }
            }
        </p>
        <p>
            When creating a class, you would normally add any default properties and methods to the class declaration.
            But what if you want to augment the class with extra methods and properties after it has been created? It
            turns out that you can still do this using theprototypeproperty of the class. This is particularly useful if
            you don't have access to the class declaration, but still want to add properties and methods to the class.

            All classes and constructor functions have a prototype property that returns an object:

            Turtle.prototype;
            Turtle {}
            All instances of the the Turtle class share all the properties and methods of its prototype. This means they
            can call any methods of the prototype and access any of its properties. Since the prototype is just an
            object, we can add new properties by assignment:

            Turtle.prototype.weapon = 'Hands';
            'Hands'
            We can also add a method to the prototype in a similar way:

            Turtle.prototype.attack = function(){
            return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`;
            }
            [Function]
            Now if we create a new Turtle instance, we can see that it inherits the weapon property and attack() method
            from the Turtle.prototype object, as well as receiving the name property and sayHi() method from the class
            declaration:

            const raph = new Turtle('Raphael');
            raph.name
            'Raphael'
            raph.sayHi()
            'Hi dude, my name is Raphael'
            raph.weapon
            'Hands'
            raph.attack()
            'Feel the power of my Hands!'
            Notice that there’s a reference to this.weapon in the prototype attack() method, and when the instance calls
            the attack() method, it uses the instance’s weapon property. This is because this in the prototype always
            refers to the instance that actually calls the method.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be careful when using the prototype to set default values. They are shallow, (There’s more about shallow and
            deep copies later in the chapter.) so any changes to an array or object made by an instance will be
            reflected in the prototype, and therefore shared between all instances.

            A golden rule to remember is:Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.

            This is not a problem if arrays or objects are set as default values from within the constructor function in
            the class declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
            The big change, however, is that now we have full control over the getter and setter methods. This means
            that any private properties can only be changed in acontrolledway, so we can stop certain assignments from
            being made by screening the data before any changes are made to a private property. For example, we could
            insist that the color property is a string:

            this.setColor = (color) => {
            if(typeof color === 'string'){
            return _color = color;
            } else {
            throw new Error('Color must be a string');
            }
            }
            raph.setColor(4);
            Error: Color must be a string
        </p>
        <p>
            class Turtle {
            constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
            }
            sayHi() {
            return `Hi dude, my name is ${this.name}`;
            }
            swim() {
            return `${this.name} paddles in the water`;
            }
            }

            This class declaration is similar to before, and defines properties and methods for anormalturtle. In our
            previous example, we then started adding more specific properties such as weapons that don't really apply to
            normal turtles, they are forninja turtles. Instead of polluting the Turtle class with these properties, it
            would be a good idea to create asub-classorchild classof the Turtle class called ninjaTurtle. This is
            created in a similar fashion, using a class declaration, but notice the use of the extends keyword:

            class NinjaTurtle extends Turtle {
            constructor(name) {
            super(name);
            this.weapon = 'hands';
            }
            attack() { return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!` }
            }
        </p>
        <p>The number, string, and boolean primitive types that we met way back in Chapter 2 have their own
            corresponding constructor functions: Number , String , and Boolean respectively.

            Rather bizarrely, though, these constructors don’t produce primitive values:

            new Number(2); // the return value looks like a primitive
            2;
            typeof Number(2); // but it's actually an object!
            "object"
            Similarly, primitive values are not instances of these constructor functions:

            2 instanceof Number;
            false
            In fact, the two things are not strictly equal:

            Number(2) === 2;
            false
            Primitives are actually without their own methods. The primitive wrapper objects Number , String , and
            Boolean are used in the background to provide primitive values with methods. When a method is called on a
            primitive value, JavaScript creates a wrapper object for the primitive, which converts it into an object and
            then calls the method on the object. This means it’s possible to call methods on primitives, as we saw in
            Chapter 2:

            2..toExponential();
            '2e+0'
            In the background, something similar to this is happening:

            new Number(2).toExponential();
            '2e+0'</p>
        <p>The Human object will be the prototype for any objects created using it as an argument and remember that
            prototypes are live. This means that any changes made to the Human object will be reflected in all the
            objects created this way.</p>
        <p>When objects are copied by assignment, they are only copied by reference. This means that another object is
            not actually created in memory; the new reference will just point to the old object. Any changes that are
            made to either objects will affect both of them. Arrays and functions are objects, so whenever they’re
            copied by assignment they will just point to the same object. And when one changes, they all change. This is
            known as making a shallow copy of an object. A deep or hard copy will create a completely new object that
            has all the same properties as the old object. The difference is that when a hard copy is changed, the
            original remains the same. But when a shallow copy is changed, the original changes too.

            This affects our mixin function when we try to copy a property that is an array or object, as can be seen in
            this example:

            const a = {};
            const b = { numbers: [1,2,3] };
            Object.assign(a,b);
            { numbers: [1,2,3] }
            a now has a reference to the numbers property in the b object, rather than its own copy. Any changes made to
            either object will affect them both:

            b.numbers.push(4);
            4
            b.numbers
            [1,2,3,4]
            a.numbers // This has also changed
            [1,2,3,4]</p>
        <p>ES6 introduced the for-of syntax for arrays and this does not require a nested function to be used, so this
            remains bound to the superman object:

            superman.findFriends = function() {
            for(const friend of this.friends) {
            console.log(`${friend.name} is friends with ${this.name}`);
            };
            }
            superman.findFriends();
            Batman is friends with Superman
            Wonder Woman is friends with Superman
            Aquaman is friends with Superman</p>
        <p>Arrow functions were introduced in ES6, and one of the advantages of using them is that they don't have their
            own this context, so this remains bound to the original object making the function call:

            superman.findFriends = function() {
            this.friends.forEach((friend) => {
            console.log(`${friend.name} is friends with ${this.name}`);
            }
            );
            }
            superman.findFriends();
            Batman is friends with Superman
            Wonder Woman is friends with Superman
            Aquaman is friends with Superman</p>
