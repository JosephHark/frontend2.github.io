        <p>Some common types of form control are:

            <strong>input</strong> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads

            <strong>select</strong> menus for drop-down lists of options

            <strong>textarea</strong> elements for longer text entry

            <strong>button</strong> elements for submitting and resetting forms
        </p>
        <a href="heroes.html">Search</a>
        <p>
            The input element includes some of the new attributes introduced in HTML5.

            The autofocus attribute give focus to this element when a page loads. It is the equivalent to putting the
            following line of JavaScript in main.js :

            document.forms.hero.heroName.focus();
            The placeholder attribute will insert the value provided in the input field until the user enters some text.
            This can be useful to place hints about how to fill in the form.

            The maxlength attribute will limit the number of characters that can be entered in the field to the value
            given (in this case 32).

            There are many new attributes that can be employed to make forms more user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>Hidden fields can be created using input fields with type='hidden' . These are not displayed by the browser,
            but have a 'value' attribute that can contain information that is submitted with the form. They are often
            used to send information such as settings or information that the user has already provided. Note that the
            information in these fields is in no way secret, as it’s visible in the HTML, so shouldn’t be used for
            sensitive data. The value of a hidden input field can be changed using JavaScript in the same was as any
            other input field.</p>
