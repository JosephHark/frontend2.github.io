        Purpose
    </h3>
    <p>
        My purpose in creating this website so to allow people to see some of the the many natural and manmade wonders of the United States. I want to allow people to get excited for going outside their doors and of their phones. In partiucalr younger people. I want people to start thinking about vacations. So I guess my target auidence would likely be middle-aged parents with yonug to teenager children. BUt I also would want to have a couple of attractions so that the kids are eager to go. Things like the Grand Canyon are amazing, and breathtaking, but to a six or seven year old it's a lot more exciting to going to the biggest mall in America where they have an indoor roller coster.

    </h3>
    <p>
        Cassandra Clare is the loving step-mother to three step children (12,11,11) two biological children (14,10) and a foster mom to a six-year old. Regardless, on top of her already busy shedulde as an accountant and her husband's job as a college dean they rarely find time to go on a trip with their children. She uses this site, and inpoint from her family to decide to go the Grand Canyon. Taking a road trip to the majestic site the family laughs, takes pictures and enjoys, for the most part, their time together. Cassanda knows that she will use this site again to plan their next trip.
