        <p>This is called form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that
            the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the
            browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side
            validation. In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.</p>
        <p>We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our applications won't work properly if our users' data
            is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.<br>
            We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect
            their account information.<br>
            We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to
            damage the application</p>
        <p><strong>Warning:</strong>
            Never trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if your form is validating correctly and
            preventing malformed input on the client-side, a malicious user can still alter the network request.</p>
        <p>There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll encounter on the web:<br>

            Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, which we've discussed in many places
            throughout this module. This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation
            has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.<br>
            JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to
            create it all (or use a library).</p>
