        <p>This is called form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation. In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.</p>
        <p>We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.<br>
            We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.<br>
            We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application</p>
        <p>Warning:
            Never trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if your form is validating correctly and preventing malformed input on the client-side, a malicious user can still alter the network request.</p>
